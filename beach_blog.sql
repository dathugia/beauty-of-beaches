Whether you\'re looking down from the viewpoint above or standing at the shore with your feet in the water, the scene is truly breathtaking. While the entire Baunei Coast is stunning, Cala Goloritzé stands out, thanks in part to its dramatic 143-metre limestone pinnacle, reminiscent of something out of a cathedral. The water here is unbelievably clear and perfect for swimming, but what truly sets this beach apart are the strong conservation efforts that protect it. Declared a natural monument in the 1990s, Cala Goloritzé remains remarkably preserved. Access is limited to those who hike in - with a restricted number of tickets sold daily - or to swimmers arriving from boats moored 200 metres away, behind a protective barrier that keeps the beach free from boat traffic. It\'s the perfect blend of unspoiled natural beauty and a beach experience unlike any other.        \n                </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-01.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n        </div>\n</div>', '<div class=\"container\">         <div class=\"more\">                 <div class=\"more__item\">                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                 Cala Goloritze WEATHER AVERAGES                         </p>                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                 <thead>                                         <tr>                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                 <td>AVG.

Additionally, Turquoise Bay is particularly known for its snorkeling right from the shore. The waters of the bay are part of the incredible Ningaloo Reef, providing up-close encounters with a diverse array of marine life in crystal-clear conditions.

This incredible feature alone makes it a captivating destination for those who appreciate unique and breathtaking beaches. Located in the Los Roques archipelago, the beach is part of a national park, ensuring its pristine condition is preserved. The turquoise waters around Cayo de Agua are shallow and incredibly clear, making it ideal for basking in the water for hours. Despite its remote location the island\'s impressive natural beauty attracts visitors looking for an escape from more crowded tourist spots.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-22.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Cayo de Agua WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

For those looking to explore, there are rocky coves and tidal pools teeming with marine life. Horseshoe Bay also features amenities such as beach rentals and a cafe, enhancing the comfort of visitors without overpowering the beach\'s natural charm. While Bermuda boasts spectacular beaches, this one stands out as a clear favorite among visitors.         \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-26.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Horseshoe Bay WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Its exceptional seclusion contributes to a tranquil atmosphere, setting it apart from the busier beaches of Phuket. The beach stretches over 300 meters, with soft white sand nestled between jungle-covered hills and the bright blue water of the Andaman Sea. The shallow waters near the shore are clear and calm, ideal for swimming without the interference of strong waves. The exclusive access and natural enclosure make Freedom Beach a preferred spot for those seeking a quiet day by the sea without the usual beach crowds of Thailand.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"beach__image\">\n        <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-28.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n    </div>\n</div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Freedom Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

The crystal-clear waters surrounding the rocks are often calm, making it the perfect place to swim and relax. The soft, white sand stretches along the beach, and visitors can navigate through the rock labyrinths, discovering secret spots and secluded coves. The Baths offers an otherworldly and more unique experience, making it an adventurous and must-see destination.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-29.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 The Baths WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

This secluded bay, accessible via a short hike through the lush terrain of a nearby golf course or by boat, offers privacy and a serene atmosphere away from the more frequented tourist spots. The clear, turquoise water is often calmer than at other beaches on the island, making it amazing for swimming. The beach is framed by the iconic large granite boulders typical of the Seychelles, enhancing its scenic beauty while also providing sheltered spots for relaxation. Anse Georgette\'s remote location and limited accessibility help preserve its untouched appeal, attracting those looking for a tranquil beach experience.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-30.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>\n\n', '<div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Anse Georgette WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

The iconic arch gives the cove its name and frames the spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean. The beach is accessible by water via boat or kayak or by a walking trail, and it remains a pristine and tranquil place to visit. The beach itself is made of golden sand and is lined with native pohutukawa trees, enhancing its scenic beauty. The surrounding cliffs are part of the Te Whanganui o Hei Marine Reserve, which helps protect the area\'s abundant marine life, also making it a prime spot for snorkeling.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-45.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>\n', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Cathedral Cove Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Located on the west coast of Antigua, it stands out for its serene, unspoiled charm and relatively low profile compared to other beaches on the island. Ffryes Beach offers a peaceful, laid-back atmosphere, with only a few low-key beach bars nearby, making it the perfect escape from more crowded, commercialized spots. The beach is known for its calm waters, ideal for families and those wanting to swim, kayak, or simply wade along the shore. Surrounded by lush, natural vegetation and framed by gentle hills, Ffryes Beach offers a sense of seclusion while still being easily accessible. Many also visit to experience some of the most stunning sunset views on the island.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-31.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Ffryes Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

This iconic peak enhances the views from the beach and water, adding to the overall experience for visitors. The area is known for its strong winds and waves, making it a favorite among kite surfers and windsurfers worldwide. Despite these active waters, parts of the beach offer calm, clear areas ideal for swimming and snorkeling, protected by coral reefs that encircle the bay. Le Morne also holds historical significance as the mountain once served as a refuge for runaway slaves, adding profound cultural importance to its natural beauty.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-33.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Le Morne Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

The surrounding park is home to a rich variety of wildlife, both on land and in the sea, making it a haven for nature lovers. The beach feels secluded and is especially popular for its crystal-clear waters, soft white sand, and dramatic landscape, all framed by the park\'s lush vegetation and rugged cliffs. Accessible only by boat or along a rugged road, the beach remains far removed from the bustling tourist areas. Bahía de las Águilas is a hidden gem offering an extraordinary natural experience.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-34.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Bahia de Las Aguilas WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

This beach is a favorite among both locals and tourists, featuring a long, pristine stretch of white sand that remains undisturbed by the bustling crowds found at more commercial beaches. Even during high season, you might find moments when it feels like you have the beach all to yourself. The water is a magical shade of turquoise, while a scattering of upscale resorts and local eateries along the shore provide convenient amenities without overshadowing the bay\'s natural charm. Additionally, the bay\'s western location offers stunning sunset views, making it a perfect spot for evening strolls and relaxed dining.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-35.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Meads Bay WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Located on Lefkada Island in Greece, the beach is backed by massive, rugged limestone cliffs, often covered with classic Mediterranean vegetation. It’s one of the few places on the island where you can experience the unique pleasure of smelling the scent of white thyme mixed with the salty sea air. The beach consists of small white pebbles, and the waters are incredibly turquoise and clear. Known for its more challenging access, most visitors come here to feel closer to nature and enjoy a tranquil escape, away from busy beach bars and roads, offering a peaceful European beach experience.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-36.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Porto Katsiki WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Located on Fitzroy Island off the coast of Queensland, it is often considered the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. Surrounded by lush tropical rainforest, the beach offers a picturesque, untouched, and secluded setting. Accessible by a short boat ride or a scenic hike from the island\'s main area, getting to the beach is part of the experience itself. Granite boulders scattered along the shore add a unique twist, while the shallow reef provides magical snorkeling opportunities.

Visible during low tide, this sandbar allows visitors to walk across the shallow, clear waters to the neighboring island. The beach itself is undeveloped, preserving its serene and unspoiled charm. The sand is fine and white, while the water is incredibly clear, providing lovely swimming conditions without big waves. As a lesser-known destination, Bon Bon Beach offers a quiet retreat compared to more tourist-heavy spots, so much so that often you could have this beach all to yourself.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-38.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Bon Bon Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Located near Tangalle on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, it’s a bit farther from the airport, ensuring a calmer, less crowded atmosphere. The golden sand and tall, slender palm trees are iconic elements of Sri Lankan beaches, and Goyambokka is a prime example of this. With only a few laid-back establishments along the beach, it remains unspoiled and peaceful, offering a great spot to relax for an entire day. The small inlet has strong waves, making it ideal for bodysurfing and catching waves. It’s also a fantastic place to witness one of Sri Lanka\'s iconic sunsets, with a backdrop of perfect palm trees.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-40.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Goyambokka Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Gardner Bay\'s expansive shore is perfect for leisurely walks or peaceful lounging, and the gentle surf makes for excellent swimming conditions.

Tucked away on Achill Island along Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way, Keem Beach is free from large developments, allowing it to remain unspoiled and serene. What also makes Keem Beach stand out is its horseshoe-shaped bay, surrounded by towering cliffs and picturesque hills, creating calmer waters that are ideal for swimming in the summer. The sand is nearly white, and the waters are among the cleanest in the area. Keem Beach is accessible via a scenic drive with panoramic coastal views, where you might even encounter the occasional sheep or two, adding to the charm of this unique beach experience.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-48.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Keem Beach WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Many beaches in the Maldives are artificial, but Kuramathi is an entirely natural island. Located in the beautiful Rasdhoo Atoll, it is more accessible from Malé by boat or seaplane. The surroundings feature all the quintessential elements of a perfect Maldivian beach—powder-soft sand and shallow waters—but the unique experience of entering the sand bank sets it apart from others. Depending on the tides, visitors can wander far out into the crystal-clear sea, often spotting amazing marine life, such as stingrays and nurse sharks. Kuramathi Sand Bank is also an ideal spot to catch a stunning sunset. Additionally, unlike the more expensive private islands in the region, Kuramathi is a more accessible option for travelers.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-49.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 Kuramathi Sand Bank WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Known for its stunning, shallow turquoise waters, La Pelosa is often compared to tropical beaches despite being in the Mediterranean. The beach is protected by a shallow bay, making the waters calm and ideal for swimming and relaxing in the water. Its unique setting, with views of the iconic 16th-century Torre della Pelosa tower and the small island of Piana, adds to its unique charm. The beach is well-maintained, with facilities such as umbrellas and sunbeds, ensuring a comfortable visit. While it does become busy in high season the beach is regulated in best efforts to preserve the beautiful nature and surroundings.        \n                                                                </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"beach__image\">\n                                                                <img src=\"https://worlds50beaches.com/assets/images/maps/map-2025-50.jpg\" alt=\"map\">\n                                                        </div>\n                                                </div>', ' <div class=\"container\">                                         <div class=\"more\">                                                 <div class=\"more__item\">                                                         <p class=\"more__item-title\" style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">                                                                 La Pelosa WEATHER AVERAGES                                                         </p>                                                         <table class=\"weather__table\">                                                                 <thead>                                                                         <tr>                                                                                 <td class=\"first__cell\"></td>                                                                                 <td>AVG.

Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the bay combines dramatic geology, rich biodiversity and a living cultural heritage preserved in its floating fishing villages. Visitors explore Ha Long by cruising traditional wooden junks or modern yachts, visiting spectacular caves such as Sung Sot (Surprise Cave), kayaking into quiet lagoons, and watching the sunrise and sunset cast golden light across the karst towers.
