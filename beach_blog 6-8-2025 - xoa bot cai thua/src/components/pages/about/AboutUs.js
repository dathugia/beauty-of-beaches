          <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
          <div className="story-content">
            <p>
              The idea for The World's 50 Best Beaches was sparked by our genuine passion for the beach. 
              As avid beach enthusiasts and travellers ourselves, we've had the privilege of experiencing 
              countless beaches across the globe. Yet, amidst the vast array of stunning shorelines, we 
              realized that discovering and experiencing truly exceptional beaches is far more difficult than it seems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by our desire to share our love for the beach and to provide a valuable resource for 
              beach lovers worldwide, we embarked on a mission to curate a comprehensive and inspiring list 
              of the world's best beaches. Drawing upon our own experiences and insights, as well as the 
              collective expertise of countless travel professionals, we wanted to create a definitive, 
              authoritative list that would inspire and inform beachgoers around the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
              As beach lovers ourselves, we understand the amazing impact that a truly exceptional beach 
              can have on one's mood and sense of well-being. It is our hope that through The World's 50 
              Best Beaches, we can inspire others to embark on their own beach adventures, to explore the 
              wonders of nature, and to experience the joy that can be found along the world's most stunning shorelines.

          <h3>OUR SELECTION PROCESS</h3>
          <div className="selection-content">
            <p>
              Each year, we reach out to thousands of the world's most experienced travel professionals, 
              and ask them to vote for what they think is the best beach on earth. Voters are not given 
              any specific criteria as to what makes a beach the best, but they are asked to describe why 
              they think it is the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              As many of the world's best beaches are yet to be discovered, our final list is not based 
              purely on votes cast. The number of votes a beach receives is a contributing factor to its 
              appearance on our list as well as its ranking.
